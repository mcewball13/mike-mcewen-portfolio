# First Portfolio

## Description
My portfolio made with HTML and CSS. I used a multitude of different styling elements. I also used proper accessability standards across the site. I added some subtle but beautiful user experience enhancements such as a slight hightlight of the image on hover and some background hover animations for the nav. I also used pure CSS for the background elements as well. I hope you ENJOY!
